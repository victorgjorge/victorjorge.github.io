# **I build operating systems that let early-stage companies scale without breaking.**

### I work hands-on with founders and leadership teams to bring structure, clarity, and execution to operations, turning chaos into a system that scales.

### Operations • Chief of Staff • Hands-on execution • Process, data, and systems

## When I’m Usually Brought In

Most early-stage teams hit a point where growth starts creating friction instead of momentum.

That’s when I’m typically called in:

- Operations are fragmented, manual, and reactive
- Founders are overloaded and stuck in day-to-day execution
- Teams are scaling faster than processes
- Decisions are made with limited visibility or data
- Execution depends too heavily on a few people

At this stage, hiring more people doesn’t solve the problem. 

**The company needs an operating system.**

## What I Do

I help companies build the foundations required to scale in a healthy, sustainable way.

My work usually includes:

- Designing and implementing core operational processes
- Creating reporting, dashboards, and performance visibility
- Establishing operating cadence (OKRs, rituals, recurring reviews)
- Implementing tools, automations, and internal systems
- Acting as a hands-on extension of the founder, COO, or leadership team

I don’t operate as an advisor on the sidelines.

I work inside the business and own execution.

## How I Work

My role adapts to the company’s stage, but my operating principles stay the same:

- Diagnose where execution and alignment break
- Build only the processes that are truly necessary
- Create clarity before adding complexity
- Use data to support decisions, not replace judgment
- Design systems that work without constant founder involvement

Titles matter less than outcomes.

My focus is making the operation run.

## Proof of Trust & International Exposure

In addition to building and scaling operational systems, I’ve been trusted with high-stakes, detail-critical work in international environments.

At **GreenMax Capital**, I was responsible for **data collection and analysis for Brazil** as part of the World Bank’s *RISE (Regulatory Indicators for Sustainable Energy)* project. I worked directly with their New York team and was brought back for this work **twice (2020 and 2022).**

During my time as **Director of Innovation & Development**, I also represented the **City of Ribeirão Preto** at international Smart City Expo World Congress, engaging with public and private sector leaders on digital government and innovation.

## Education & Analytical Foundation

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Business Economics and Controllership**, providing a strong foundation in:

- Financial statement analysis
- Cost structures and unit economics
- Performance monitoring and reporting

This background directly informs how I design operational systems, dashboards, and performance reviews.

---

## What I’m Not Looking For

To avoid misalignment:

- Corporate-heavy environments with limited autonomy
- Roles focused on maintaining process rather than building systems
- Teams that value bureaucracy over execution

I do my best work in environments built on trust, ownership, and speed.
