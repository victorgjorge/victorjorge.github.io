                            <p>Grupo BILD (including BILD and Vitta) is a large Brazilian real estate and construction group with complex commercial operations and a strong focus on scale and efficiency. As part of the group's innovation area, I was appointed as Product Manager responsible for leading the development of a new digital product ecosystem for the commercial function.</p>
                            <p>The initiative had two strategic objectives:</p>
                            <ul class="case-block-list case-block-list-numbered">
                                <li>Replace a critical legacy commercial system — built exclusively for the group, based on outdated code, and increasingly limited in scalability and flexibility.</li>
                                <li>Design the new solution as a SaaS (Software as a Service) product, enabling the group to open a new business vertical by commercializing the platform to other construction and real estate companies.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This required balancing internal operational needs with external market viability from day one.</p>

                            <p>The existing commercial system presented multiple structural challenges:</p>

                                <li>Outdated and rigid codebase, difficult to evolve or integrate</li>
                                <li>High dependency on internal customizations</li>
                                <li>Limited ability to scale or adapt to different business models</li>
                                <li>No feasibility for commercialization beyond the group</li>

                            <p>At the same time, simply rebuilding a like-for-like replacement would fail to capture a larger strategic opportunity: transforming an internal tool into a scalable, configurable, and market-ready SaaS ecosystem.</p>
                            <p>The core challenge was to:</p>

                            <p>In mid-2019 and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil faced severe challenges in monitoring healthcare system capacity, particularly hospital bed availability. At the state level, the São Paulo government implemented the Plano São Paulo, a regulatory framework that classified regions based on critical indicators — one of the most important being hospital and ICU bed occupancy rates. These classifications directly influenced mobility restrictions and economic activity.</p>
                            <p>Given my background and interest in innovation applied to public sector management, I was invited to join a Grupo BILD initiative as Product Manager for a public-interest project developed on a pro bono basis.</p>
                            <p>The result was LeitosCOVID.org, a digital platform designed to centralize and standardize real-time data on hospital bed occupancy — including regular and ICU beds — across all hospitals in Ribeirão Preto, a city of over 700,000 inhabitants and headquarters of Grupo BILD.</p>

Alongside my day-to-day product work, I invested in my professional development by completing a specialization in digital product management, launching the group's digital product ecosystem across additional regions, and engaging in a structured mentorship process with my direct manager.</p>
