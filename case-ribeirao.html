                            <p>When I took on the role of Director of Innovation and Development at the Ribeirão Preto City Hall, the municipality faced a structural challenge common to large Brazilian cities:</p>
                            <p>the process of opening, modifying, and closing a business was highly bureaucratic, fragmented across departments, and largely manual.</p>
                            <p>At that time, there was no unified digital flow connecting municipal secretariats, state-level systems, and licensing authorities. Entrepreneurs and accountants were required to navigate multiple public offices, duplicating information and dealing with long processing times and low transparency.</p>
                            <p>Empresa Fácil became the first end-to-end digital transformation project led by the Secretariat of Innovation and Development, with the explicit mandate to modernize the business registration experience and position Ribeirão Preto as a reference in digital government and economic development.</p>

                            <p>The existing business registration model presented several systemic issues:</p>

                                <li>Fragmented processes across multiple municipal departments</li>

                                <li>Lack of real-time visibility for entrepreneurs and accountants</li>
                                <li>High bureaucratic burden, discouraging formalization and economic activity</li>
                                <li>Limited interoperability with state-level systems such as VRE / JUCESP</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Without structural change, the municipality would continue to operate with high administrative cost, slow service delivery, and low citizen satisfaction.</p>
