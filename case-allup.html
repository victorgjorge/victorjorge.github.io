                        <div class="case-block-content">
                            <p>When I joined allUP, the company was experiencing rapid growth, reflected in a rising number of clients and job opportunities that needed to be published quickly on the platform. Although the product already had a live iOS app, the job creation and publishing process was highly manual, fragmented across multiple tools, and not designed for scale.</p>
                            <p>New opportunities required extensive backstage configuration, heavy coordination across teams, and workarounds to support non-iOS applicants. As volume increased, this setup created operational risk, slowed down time-to-market, and concentrated critical knowledge in a single role.</p>
                            <p>I was hired with two clear objectives:</p>
                            <ul class="case-block-list case-block-list-numbered">
                                <li>Design a sustainable, scalable, and efficient job publishing process</li>
                                <li>Increase speed and throughput, enabling new opportunities to go live as fast as possible</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <p>The initial workflow suffered from several structural limitations:</p>
                            <ul class="case-block-list">
                                <li>Manual job setup across multiple tools and systems</li>
                                <li>No centralized orchestration of tasks, dependencies, and ownership</li>
                                <li>High coordination cost between Operations, Product, Marketing, and Engineering</li>
                                <li>Separate and fragile application flows for Android users</li>
                                <li>Low automation and high cognitive load</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Without a structural redesign, operational complexity would continue to grow faster than the business itself.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="case-block">

                        <div class="case-block-content">
                            <p>I designed and operated a centralized, SOP-driven workflow, using Notion as the operational control layer during the company's early scaling phase.</p>
                            <p>My responsibilities included:</p>
                            <ul class="case-block-list">
                                <li>Building a lightweight CRM in Notion to track clients and their job opportunities</li>
                                <li>Creating job-level operational cards to orchestrate all required actions</li>
                                <li>Defining a standardized SOP with clear ownership across teams</li>
                                <li>Centralizing all job-related information (role details, compensation, location, workplace type, job descriptions)</li>
                                <li>Managing the end-to-end job configuration and publishing process</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>At that stage, I also operated a parallel application flow for Android users, coordinating configurations across tools such as Typeform, VideoAsk, and Zapier to ensure applicants received consistent communication and status updates.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <h2 class="case-block-title">Operational Evolution & Automation</h2>
                        <div class="case-block-content">
                            <p>Due to my ownership of the full workflow, I also became responsible for identifying opportunities to simplify and automate the operation. I led this process in close collaboration with Weston (COO & Co-Founder).</p>
                            <p>Over time, we progressively reduced complexity and removed temporary workarounds by:</p>
                            <ul class="case-block-list">
                                <li>Eliminating parallel application flows and third-party dependencies</li>
                                <li>Enabling web-based applications, allowing candidates to apply regardless of device</li>
                                <li>Designing and implementing a unified job creation flow within the admin system</li>
                                <li>Migrating job descriptions and configuration logic from Notion directly into the admin</li>
                                <li>Leveraging existing Prompt Workshop references to independently create prompts without cross-team dependency</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This transition transformed the operation from a tool-heavy workaround into a clean, productized workflow.</p>

                            <p>As allUP scaled its marketplace, publishing jobs on the platform was not enough. The company needed to ensure consistent candidate demand for a growing number of active opportunities, while maintaining operational control over cost and efficiency.</p>
                            <p>To support this, allUP created a dedicated LinkedIn page — Jobs by allUP — designed to distribute live opportunities and route candidates directly into the platform. At this stage, LinkedIn operated under a variable, pay-per-post cost model, which made distribution efficiency a critical operational concern.</p>
                            <p>I was responsible for operating, measuring, and evolving this distribution layer, ensuring the marketplace remained balanced as volume increased.</p>

                            <p>Under the variable-cost model, job distribution presented several risks:</p>
                            <ul class="case-block-list">
                                <li>Each job post required manual setup and paid distribution, often city by city</li>
                                <li>Costs scaled linearly with volume, increasing financial exposure</li>
                                <li>Limited visibility into which roles, cities, or categories generated demand more efficiently</li>
                                <li>No structured criteria to decide when to repost, pause, or stop investing in a role</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Without a clear performance and cost-feedback loop, scaling distribution would quickly become inefficient and unsustainable.</p>

                            <p>Once a job was live on the allUP platform, I managed the end-to-end LinkedIn distribution workflow, including:</p>

                                <li>Structuring job information for LinkedIn distribution</li>

                            <p>To operate efficiently under variable costs, I built a performance tracking framework focused on operational decision-making. This included:</p>

                                <li>Tracking views, applicants, and spend per job</li>
                                <li>Analyzing performance by role type, city, and category</li>
                                <li>Identifying efficiency patterns across markets</li>
                                <li>Defining saturation thresholds to guide reposting and spend allocation</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                                <li>Detect diminishing returns as applicant volume plateaued</li>
                                <li>Support decisions to scale, pause, or reallocate distribution</li>

                            <p>As LinkedIn distribution costs became a significant operational expense, I supported the transition to a fixed-cost posting agreement, enabling near-unlimited job distribution for a monthly fee.</p>
                            <p>With this shift:</p>

                                <li>The operation scaled from approximately 50 active job posts to 1,200+ concurrent postings</li>
                                <li>Cost per applicant decreased as volume increased</li>
                                <li>High posting volume became a strategic requirement to fully leverage the fixed-cost model</li>

                            <p>At this stage, optimization moved from individual post efficiency to portfolio-level distribution strategy, ensuring the fixed cost was amortized across a large number of active roles.</p>
