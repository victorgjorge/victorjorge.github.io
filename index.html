            <p class="section-intro">Most early-stage teams hit a point where growth starts creating friction instead of momentum. That's when I'm typically called in:</p>
            <ul class="problem-list">
                <li>Operations are fragmented, manual, and reactive</li>
                <li>Founders are overloaded and stuck in day-to-day execution</li>
                <li>Teams are scaling faster than processes</li>
                <li>Decisions are made with limited visibility or data</li>
                <li>Execution depends too heavily on a few people</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="highlight-text">At this stage, hiring more people doesn't solve the problem. <strong>The company needs an operating system.</strong></p>
